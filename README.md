# GUI for Headless Installers
I had a strange dream, but in the dream was an installer that only had the progression and a progression bar.
Since I'm having problems adding the picture here, I'll talk about it till I get on the windows machine instead. ;P 

# Functionality
It uses a headless installer such as pacman, and when you copy or just mark a segment from a loaded file it will automatically be pasted/injected into a loop that checks if every application is viable for install, and they are added to the 'gui' where it's only a total install progression, and a progression bar, when an application is installed it changes colour, and you can see which one's were read in and installed. Those that didn't didn't make the cut, it's supposed to have a minimalist feel and look, while the loops and checks before it either uses pacman, apt, yum, dnf, yay, paru, apt-get, or whatever. The only thing you did with the file, was add a segment name like a function and add a list of applications. It's nice to have a file that you save and just download one installer interface and it installs everything for you. 

### Here's an illustration that I made in gimp.
